> [Inexperienced designers] don't think of every design project as a design system. They don't appreciate the interconnectedness of their design decisions. They solve design problems in isolation, not as a whole.

# [Disabled buttons suck](https://axesslab.com/disabled-buttons-suck/) but [they don't have to](https://stories.justinewin.com/disabled-buttons-dont-have-to-suck-10da0bb6d37e)

Two great articles for the price of one. I admit, I was not aware of all of the reasons disabled buttons suck. The proposed alternatives (to disabling buttons) in the second article feel like common sense and result in a better UX regardless of whether or not you have disabilities.

# [Next Gen CSS: `@container`](https://css-tricks.com/next-gen-css-container/)

Chrome [recently shipped](https://twitter.com/una/status/1375419967718449155) an experimental implementation of `@container` queries in Chrome behind a flag. If you're not familiar with container queries — [the MDN page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Container_Queries) cuts to the chase pretty quickly, but in short — they represent a fundamental change to the way we make sites responsive. Rather than applying styles to elements when the _viewport_ is at a certain size, they allow us to apply styles when the _elements themselves_ (or "containers") are at a certain size.

Now that it's 2021 and everything is a component, you can probably imagine why this would be a groundbreaking change. (And yes, we've been able to do this for years now using `ResizeObserver` but `@container` queries allow us to do it purely with CSS.)

This is weird. And cool and powerful. But mostly weird. Also shoutout to those of you who like me had this exact thing decades ago via [Active Desktop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Desktop).
