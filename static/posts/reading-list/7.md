# [Substack's UI and 1Password just cost me $2,023](https://timmyomahony.com/blog/substacks-ui-and-1password-just-cost-me-2023-dollars)

Cautionary tale about display logic, hidden inputs, and autofill. Plenty of useful takeaways but two obvious ones: 1) the `name` you give inputs very much matters and 2) don't get cute with form design.

# [Accessibility Menu on Fool.com](https://www.fool.com/)

Someone I follow on Twitter called attention to the awesome accessibility menu in the bottom right corner of every page on Fool.com. Play with some of these optionsâ€”it's awesome how configurable they've made their site in the name of inclusive usability.
