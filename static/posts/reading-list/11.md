# [Customization vs. Configuration in Evolving Design Systems](https://engineering.atspotify.com/2021/04/28/customization-vs-configuration-in-evolving-design-systems/)

An excellent article on levels of abstraction in design systems by the engineering team at Spotify. The article compares low level component abstraction (customization) to high level abstraction (configurable). It's so good I wish I'd written it myself.

> When evolving a design system, there is a range of strategies you can take. A more abstract configuration approach can increase consistency and maintainability, but at the risk of the system being a bottleneck for outgoing features. The less abstract customization approach enables quicker feature development; however, overall consistency of the product can suffer as a result.

Colin Shanley sheds light on a rarely discussed aspect of accessibility: font legibility. You may have heard that [Comic Sans is actually easier to read for people with dyslexia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_Sans#Use_in_schools). This article explains why.

Sarah Drasner [open sourced](https://github.com/sdras/career-ladders) a set of career ladders that are easy to understand, describe meaningful progression and contribution, and brief(!). I especially liked this bullet point under the description for tech lead:

> A tech lead gently enforces standards- culture and attitudes included. If the team has misalignment, a tech lead spends time alongside the Engineering Manager to guide them towards productivity.
