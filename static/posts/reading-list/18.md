# [Astro + React + Vue Counter Demo](https://github.com/cassidoo/astro-react-vue-demo)

Netlify's Cassidy Williams made a demo to illustrate the flexibility of Astro, the static site generator I [covered](https://mturco.com/reading-list/16#introducing-astro-ship-less-javascript) a few weeks ago. Take a look at [this `index.astro` page](https://github.com/cassidoo/astro-react-vue-demo/blob/main/src/pages/index.astro) which casually imports React and Vue components alongside each other, passes them some shared data, and renders them. 

Please re-read that paragraph if your mind isn't racing right now. ðŸ˜µ

# [Optical size, the hidden superpower of variable fonts](https://pixelambacht.nl/2021/optical-size-hidden-superpower/)

A brief explainer on optical sizing, a lesser known feature of variable fonts that allows typefaces to alter character glyphs based on font size.

# [An incomplete list of skills senior engineers need, beyond coding](https://skamille.medium.com/an-incomplete-list-of-skills-senior-engineers-need-beyond-coding-8ed4a521b29f)

This Medium post had been sitting in my reading list for a few weeks but I finally got around to reading it. Here are a few that particularly resonated with me:

> 1. How to run a meeting, and no, being the person who talks the most in the meeting is not the same thing as running it
> 
> 19. How to help someone get promoted
>
> 21. How to find interesting work on your own, instead of waiting for someone to bring it to you

# [Temporal: getting started with JavaScriptâ€™s new date time API](https://2ality.com/2021/06/temporal-api.html)

If you haven't yet dug into [Temporal API](https://tc39.es/proposal-temporal/docs/) â€” a saving grace for JavaScript's awful `Date` API â€” now is a good time. It reached stage 3 status a few months ago (making it all but guaranteed to make it into EcmaScript) and 2ality (an excellent resource in general) has just published a nice introductory guide.

Just one of the things that makes `Temporal` a life-saver:

> Temporal distinguishes two kinds of time. Given a global instant of time:
>
> - Wall-clock time (also called local time or clock time) varies globally, depending on the time zone of a clock.
> - Exact time (also called UTC time) is the same everywhere.
>
> Epoch time is one way of representing exact time: Itâ€™s a number counting time units (such as nanoseconds) before or since Unix epoch (midnight UTC on January 1, 1970).

# [Benchmarking JavaScript Memory Usage](https://blog.webpagetest.org/posts/benchmarking-javascript-memory-usage/)

The team at [WebPageTest](https://webpagetest.org/) did a deep dive on memory usage in modern web apps. There are some unsurprising findings (like JS bundle size strongly correlating with memory usage) and some findings I didn't expect (like number of DOM nodes having a fairly _weak_ correlation to memory usage).

# [JS Is Weird](https://jsisweird.com/)

An absurd but fun quiz to test your knowledge of JavaScript's quirks. I got 15 out of 25 correct. ðŸ˜¬
