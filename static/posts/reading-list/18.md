# [Astro + React + Vue Counter Demo](https://github.com/cassidoo/astro-react-vue-demo)

Netlify's Cassidy Williams made a demo to illustrate the flexibility of Astro, the static site generator I [covered](https://mturco.com/reading-list/16#introducing-astro-ship-less-javascript) a few weeks ago. Take a look at this [`index.astro`](https://github.com/cassidoo/astro-react-vue-demo/blob/main/src/pages/index.astro) page which casually imports React and Vue components alongside each other and then renders them next to each other. It even passes some shared data to each component. 

Please re-read that paragraph if your mind isn't racing with the endless possibilities. ðŸ˜µ

> 
> 19. How to help someone get promoted
>
> 21. How to find interesting work on your own, instead of waiting for someone to bring it to you
