# [An incomplete list of skills senior engineers need, beyond coding](https://skamille.medium.com/an-incomplete-list-of-skills-senior-engineers-need-beyond-coding-8ed4a521b29f)

This Medium post had been sitting in my reading list for a few weeks now but I finally got around to reading it. And wow, as a senior engineer, is it humbling. Here are a few of my favorites:

> 1. How to run a meeting, and no, being the person who talks the most in the meeting is not the same thing as running it
> 
> 19. How to help someone get promoted
>
> 21. How to find interesting work on your own, instead of waiting for someone to bring it to you
