# [The Animal is tired](http://www.robinhobb.com/blog/posts/38429)

A bit different from the type of content I usually share but I liked the message this bit of creative writing drives home.

# [16 Lessons Learned From Five Years As An Enterprise Technologist, Part 1](https://medium.com/rocket-mortgage-technology-blog/16-lessons-learned-from-five-years-as-an-enterprise-technologist-part-1-abe2a2734539) — and also [Part 2](https://medium.com/rocket-mortgage-technology-blog/16-lessons-learned-from-five-years-as-an-enterprise-technologist-part-2-37407526da0a)!

A great 2-part blog post with plenty of good advice on working with others to build software. The headings for each tip even stand on their own, like _Humor Can Break Barriers_ and _Processes Are Good, But Don't Forget To Think_.

Lastly, a quote of a quote that I loved:

> "If everyone is thinking alike, then someone isn’t thinking"
>

# [Learn CSS!](https://web.dev/learn/css/) on web.dev

Google's web.dev site has long been an awesome resource. New to the site is a comprehensive section on learning CSS broken down by concept. Each concept has an accompanying podcast episode and loads of interactive code examples. This is probably the best singular resource for learning CSS I've seen. I love how the content is structured. The page on [pseudo-classes](https://web.dev/learn/css/pseudo-classes/) would by itself be worth a share.

# [The future of Internet Explorer on Windows 10 is in Microsoft Edge](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2021/05/19/the-future-of-internet-explorer-on-windows-10-is-in-microsoft-edge/)

Microsoft is firing more warning shots with regards to IE's deprecation by announcing that IE11 will officially be "retired and go out of support" on June 15, 2022.

A [comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27214771) from a random Hacker News user:

> This is what I love about Microsoft. While Google is eager to go ahead and cancel Google Cloud Print and say "find an alternative before next month", Microsoft would be the company to announce it'll be cancelled in 2023, extended support lasts until 2029, and you can buy Extended Warranty 365+ for Business that lasts until 2067.

# [Poor in Tech](http://megelison.com/poor-in-tech)

This outsider-looking-in list of observations from a self-described "poor person in tech" resulted in some controversy online but I found it interesting and at times funny. Some are relatable, some are not, but it's an interesting perspective.

> I knew I was the only poor person at my tech startup because I thought my coworker was kidding when he said he was spending the three-day weekend in Greece. When I finished laughing, four people recommended hotels.

# [Xiaohan Zou's Portfolio](https://portfolio.zxh.io/)

This engineer's portfolio website is a surprisingly polished recreation of macOS, complete with markdown notes in Bear, a working terminal with files to `ls` and `cat`, and an iframe'd Safari through which you can browse her blog. Oh, and the source code is viewable in a working version of VS Code. Why, what have _you_ been doing with your free time?
