# [mmm.page](https://build.mmm.page/)

This week's "cool but also wtf" moment is brought to you by [mmm.page](https://build.mmm.page/) which lets you build a web page by dragging and dropping random preset elements onto the page.

# [The Animal is tired](http://www.robinhobb.com/blog/posts/38429)

A bit different from the type of content I usually share but I liked the message this bit of creative writing drives home.

# [Xiaohan Zou's Portfolio](https://portfolio.zxh.io/)

This engineer's portfolio website is a surprisingly polished recreation of macOS, complete with markdown notes in Bear, a working terminal with files to `ls` and `cat`, and an iframe'd Safari through which you can browse her blog. Oh, and the source code is viewable in a working version of VS Code. Why, what have _you_ been doing with your free time?

# [Learn CSS! (web.dev)](https://web.dev/learn/css/)

Google's web.dev site has long been an awesome resource. New to the site is a comprehensive section on learning CSS broken down by concept. Each concept has an accompanying podcast episode and loads of interactive code examples. This is probably the best singular resource for learning CSS I've seen. I love how the content is structured. The page on [pseudo-classes](https://web.dev/learn/css/pseudo-classes/) would by itself be worth a share.
