# [The return of fancy tools](https://macwright.com/2021/03/16/return-of-fancy-tools.html)

I liked this commentary on the trend of software tools becoming more complex again (after a previous trend towards simplicity). A relatable example from the post:

> Visual Studio was “disrupted” by Sublime Text and TextMate, which are now getting replaced by Visual Studio Code.

This quote made me think about what it is about Markdown that I love so much:

> Fancy tools aren’t bad. Professional authors use Microsoft Word and they have the absolute courage, the phenomenal self-control, to never fiddle with fonts. I, however, don’t.

Markdown forces you to focus on the content and the structure of your content.

# [Ask HN: What lessons did you learn from your best or worst colleagues?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27161901)

As with any Hacker News comment thread, I recommend mostly sticking to the top-level comments. A few of my favorite lessons shared:

> Failures of people are as often due to the environment they're in as they are the people. That can be useful to not judge colleagues too harshly, and also to remind yourself you are good and capable when you find yourself in a job/role where you're unable to function. ([source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27162575))

> I learned from my best colleagues: success is about trust. Nothing pays better dividends than being humble, being right a lot, and doing good work. This builds allies and allies build careers. ([source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27162278))

> From the best: "Every if statement is death" was an adage of one. He encouraged me to think deeper about whether conditionals were really needed, and at what place they were needed. That mindset helped me write clearer and more easily testable code. ([source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27164369))


# [50 Tips to Improve User Interface](https://fifty.user-interface.io/50_ui_tips.pdf)

A compilation of 50 tweets by [Victor Ponamariov](https://twitter.com/vponamariov) containing UI tips. I love these kind of bite-sized, practical design tips which can help even those without design education/experience pull off a competent UI.

# [TypeScript Generics for People Who Gave Up on Understanding Generics](https://ts.chibicode.com/generics)

This article (and [the site](https://ts.chibicode.com/) in general) by a Vercel engineer is a great TypeScript resource. It makes no assumptions about what other concepts you may or may not already know.
