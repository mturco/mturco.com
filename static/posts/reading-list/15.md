# [What I'm thinking about: Identity](https://ckarchive.com/b/p9ueh9h0vgpg)

Nicholas Zakas reflects on a time he, a frontend engineer, was asked to help with a backend issue and how it changed his mindset about his identity.

> That is who I was. That is what I did. Frontend stuff. Not backend stuff, never. Just frontend stuff.

# [Things your manager might not know](https://jvns.ca/blog/things-your-manager-might-not-know/)

Julia Evans on things we might assume our managers know and therefore don't explicitly tell them. I really liked Julia's conclusion:

> Being good at telling your manager the right information at the right time and asking for what you need is a superpower. It makes you way more valuable to have on a team (because your manager knows they can trust you to give them the information they need), and it’s more likely that you’ll get what you want (because you’re making it easy for them to do that!).

> This skill takes a lot of time to learn but it’s pretty easy to practice. You can take a few minutes to reflect before your 1:1 with your manager and think about what might be important to bring up with them.
