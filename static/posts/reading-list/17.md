# [How a single cloud computing customer caused half the Internet to go dark](https://www.vox.com/recode/2021/6/8/22524024/fastly-web-outage-news-websites)

Rebecca Heilweil explains the Fastly outage that caused major news outlets, payment platforms and many other sites to go down. She goes over the serious consequences of the consolidation in computing service companies like Fastly, and how the complexity and countless moving parts of these systems can make a trivial mistake potentially blow things up.

# [Why you should never use .toBe in Jest](https://dev.to/thejaredwilcurt/why-you-should-never-use-tobe-in-jest-48ca)

A teammate and I have been discussing whether we should be using the `toBe` or `toEqual` method when asserting a primitive value. This article provides an interesting perspective on why we should be using `toEqual` for primitive values because there is no difference in performance and as well for uniformity and code readability.

# [7 leadership skills for junior developers: how to prepare for a senior role](https://simpleprogrammer.com/7-leadership-skills-senior-developer/)

I thought this was a good reminder on the things you can do to level up your game. Josip Miskovic also provides action steps you can take as well.

# [Trigonometry in CSS and JavaScript](https://tympanus.net/codrops/2021/06/01/trigonometry-in-css-and-javascript-introduction-to-trigonometry/)

Who said frontend doesn't involve math? Michelle Barker shows how you can apply trigonometry to create cool CSS effects. There are more examples in the [second part](https://tympanus.net/codrops/2021/06/02/trigonometry-in-css-and-javascript-getting-creative-with-trigonometric-functions/) if you're interested in learning more.
