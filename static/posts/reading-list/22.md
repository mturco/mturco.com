# [The Future Of The Web](https://www.hazem.cool/blog/the-future-of-the-web)

Hazem Osama with some bold thoughts about the future of the web and how it has begun toâ€”and will continue toâ€”replace native apps.

# [Could, should, might, shouldn't â€“ A taxonomy of futurists](https://medium.com/@fosta/could-should-might-shouldnt-a-taxonomy-of-futurists-2356cf4ceb79)

Continuing the future theme, I liked this comparison of futurists laid out by Nick Foster, Head of Design at X (which you probably know by its former name, Google X).

Someone explain this to me. ðŸ˜®

# [@laurieontech on "people who appear super smart"](https://twitter.com/laurieontech/status/1422614224170373125)

I liked and related to this tweet by Laurie Barth (Netflix).

When you're just starting as an engineer (or really in any profession), meeting people like this can cause a bit of imposter syndrome. It's important to realize that no one can be an expert in everything.

Your eventual goal should be to become ["T-shaped"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shaped_skills).

# [Safari isn't protecting the web, it's killing it](https://httptoolkit.tech/blog/safari-is-killing-the-web/)

An exhaustive rebuttal on a contentious topic by Tim Perry.

The list of features supported by all major browsers but Safari (and when they were implemented by those other browsers) is pretty damning. As is the list of features now implemented but many _years_ after Chrome/Firefox. Date and time inputs have been supported by Chrome for _9 years_ and just shipped in Safari 14.1. ðŸ˜µ

I thought the sentiment that "Safari is the new IE" was a bit premature but now I think I agree.

> According to [Can I Use](https://caniuse.com/)'s metrics, Safari is lacking about 10% behind Firefox and 15% behind Chrome in feature support. That's including every basic feature like HTML images, forms and links - so it's a major underestimation of the modern feature set.

# [How To Learn Stuff Quickly](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/blog/how-to-learn-stuff-quickly/)

A great post by Josh Comeau on learning how to learn as a developer. He also hits on plenty of good subtopics, like adopting a growth mindset:

> Many years ago, I went bowling with some friends. I didn't do well. [...] There are two different ways to interpret this scenario:
>
> 1. I'm just not good at bowling, and I never will be. Bowling just isn't my thing.
> 2. I'm not good at bowling. If I want to, though, I can become an excellent bowler.
>
> There is a self-fulfilling prophecy aspect to this: whichever interpretation you choose will be correct. If you think that your level of bowling skill is fixed, it will be. If you believe that you can improve, you will!
