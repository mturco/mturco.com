  Codebase)](https://www.samueltaylor.org/articles/how-to-learn-a-codebase.html?utm_source=hackernewsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_term=code)

    If you can get past the extremely click-baity nature of the intro (and title which was so bad that I used the slug to avoid repeating it here lol), there's actually an interesting article underneath on how motivation has very little effect on achieving goals.

    > The researchers discovered that what pulls that desire out of you and turns it into realâ€“world action isn't your level of motivation, but rather your plan for implementation.
