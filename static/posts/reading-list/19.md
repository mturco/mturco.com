# [npm audit: Broken by Design](https://overreacted.io/npm-audit-broken-by-design/)

Dan Abramov expresses frustration about the current state of `npm audit`, security vulnerabilities, andâ€”to borrow his ðŸ‘Œ termâ€”"security theater".

From a frontend standpoint, the root of that frustration is that most of the flagged theoretical vulnerabilities tend to be in packages that run at build time (in the terminal) and not at runtime (in the browser). This makes the vulnerable party _you_ and not _your users_. On top of that, leveraging most of these vulnerabilities requires access to your source code or your machine.

# [YAGNI exceptions](https://lukeplant.me.uk/blog/posts/yagni-exceptions/)

A list of exceptions to the [YAGNI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it) rule-of-thumb. In other words, things you likely _are_ going to need (or wish you had) at some point. Two I really liked:

> Logging. Especially for after-the-fact debugging, and in non-deterministic or hard to reproduce situations, where it is often too late to add it after you become aware of a problem.

> Timestamps. [...] instead of a boolean flag, e.g. `completed`, a nullable timestamp of when the state was entered, `completed_at`, can be much more useful.

# [Reasons to Listen to Whom You Donâ€™t Agree With](https://meiert.com/en/blog/listen/)

Jens Oliver Meiert reminds us why listening to people we don't agree with often leads to a positive outcome.

Just as there's frequently more to learn from failures than successes, there can be more to learn from people we disagree with than those we agree with. And, as Meiert points out, blocking those we disagree with is like slowly curating our own personal echo chamber.
