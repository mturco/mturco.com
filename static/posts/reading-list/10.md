# [How often do people actually copy and paste from Stack Overflow? Now we know.](https://stackoverflow.blog/2021/04/19/how-often-do-people-actually-copy-and-paste-from-stack-overflow-now-we-know/)

Stack Overflow recently collected some data (as part of an April Fool's Day joke no less) that revealed **one in four visitors** to Stack Overflow copies code from it. I, for one, am appalled. [You wouldn't _download a car_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_Wouldn%27t_Steal_a_Car), would you?

You know, from the general public. What could go wrong?

# [swimlanes.io](https://swimlanes.io/)

Having previously looked into Markdown-driven flowchart tools and been disappointed, I was pleasantly surprised by swimlanes.io which seems to get _a lot_ right: reasonable syntax, impressively good editor with instant preview, optional sign up, and the ability to directly link to an autogenerated image of the chart.

Charlie Gerard (engineer at Netlify) makes the where-would-I-even-begin seem actually fairly well-that-didn't-seem-_too_-bad in this breakdown of her [Dark mode clap extension](https://github.com/charliegerard/dark-mode-clap-extension).
