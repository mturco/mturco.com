# [Warp‚ÄîThe blazingly fast, Rust-based terminal](https://www.warp.dev/)

I've had my eyes on (but not yet hands on) Warp which is a new terminal (please hold your üôÑ) written in Rust (ü§≠). The heavily promised speed is table stakes. It must be fast or else it might as well be [Hyper](https://hyper.is/) (thankfully, unlike Hyper, Warp is not Electron-based).

What really has my interest though are things like: the "blocks" concept which nicely groups a command with its output (and allows it to be shared via URL ü§î), the multi-line and multi-cursor support, command palette, and autocomplete (which looks a lot like [Fig](/reading-list/15/#fig) but integrated into the terminal).

Warp is still in early access but keep your eyes on it‚Äîit looks promising.

# [Best practices for writing code comments](https://stackoverflow.blog/2021/07/05/best-practices-for-writing-code-comments/)

Solid guidelines for code comments. My favorite:

> Rule 3: If you can't write a clear comment, there may be a problem with the code

The explanation for this rule references Kernighan's Law (which was new to me):

> Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it.

I absolutely love it.

# [The unreasonable effectiveness of just showing up everyday](https://typesense.org/blog/the-unreasonable-effectiveness-of-just-showing-up-everyday/)

The success story of Typesense, an open source search engine whose creators took a non-flashy, patient approach to its development:

> We did not quit our day jobs to start working on Typesense full-time immediately. We did not seek venture capital or attempt to "corner" the market by chasing hyper growth. We did not have personal brands or wide networks to tap into. We did not even earn the first dollar till the 5th year.

The author shares some advice for replicating their success:

> Pick an idea in a large market that will always be in demand and work on a product that caters to a subset of use cases exceedingly well.

# [On HTML Attributes vs DOM Properties](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6003819/what-is-the-difference-between-properties-and-attributes-in-html/6004028#6004028)

A concise explainer on a topic that often causes confusion. Making matters worse is that syntax like JSX furthers this confusion by allowing setting HTML attributes _and_ DOM properties interchangeably via "props"... whose syntax looks like attributes. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

# [Setups](https://setups.co/)

A collection of personal workspace photos. Useful if you're looking for inspiration to redo your workspace or "setup".

# [Reddit's disrespectful design](https://ognjen.io/reddits-disrespectful-design/)

Reddit has recently been employing some gross [dark UX patterns](https://www.darkpatterns.org/) including deliberately confusing users, forcing them onto native apps, and disguising ads as user content.
